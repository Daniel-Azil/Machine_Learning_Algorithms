### Implementation of 1D Linear Regression with PyTorch

#### Overview

This Jupyter Notebook contains a simple implementation of 1D linear regression using PyTorch. The goal is to showcase the process of training a linear regression model with varying learning rates and observing the training and validation errors.

#### Contents

- **Data Generation:** Artificial data is created with outliers, providing both training and validation datasets.
- **Linear Regression Model:** A PyTorch model is defined for 1D linear regression.
- **Training Loop:** The model is trained with different learning rates using stochastic gradient descent.
- **Results:** Training and validation errors are recorded for each learning rate.
