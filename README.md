## Implementation of 1D Linear Regression with PyTorch

### Overview

This Jupyter Notebook contains a simple implementation of 1D linear regression using PyTorch. The goal is to showcase the process of training a linear regression model with varying learning rates and observing the training and validation errors.

### Contents

- **Data Generation:** Artificial data is created with outliers, providing both training and validation datasets.
- **Linear Regression Model:** A PyTorch model is defined for 1D linear regression.
- **Training Loop:** The model is trained with different learning rates using stochastic gradient descent.
- **Results:** Training and validation errors are recorded for each learning rate.

### Usage

1. Adjust the hyperparameters and learning rates as needed.
2. Run the code to observe the training process and error metrics.
3. Visualize the results to understand the impact of different learning rates on model performance.

Feel free to explore the code, experiment with hyperparameters, and gain insights into the training dynamics of a simple linear regression model.
